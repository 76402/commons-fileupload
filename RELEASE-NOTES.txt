                           Commons FileUpload Package
                         Version 1.0 Release Candidate 1
                                 Release Notes


INTRODUCTION
============

This document contains the release notes for this version of the Commons
FileUpload component, and highlights changes since the previous version.


NEW FEATURES
============

* The FileUpload class has been split into an abstract base class and two
  concrete classes, one of which is specific to a disk-based repository and
  the other a more generic implementation. Clients who previously used the
  disk-specific functionality of FileUpload should use DiskFileUpload instead.

* Instances of the FileItem interface are now created by a factory, and custom
  factories are supported. This allows for much greater flexibility in creating
  customized FileUpload applications.

* The size threshold now applies to the size of individual items, rather than
  the overall size of the request. This brings the implmentation in line with
  the original documentation, as well as better meeting user expectations.

* More specific exceptions are thrown for invalid content type, unknown size
  and size limit exceeded.
